ODES is an online dynamic examination application plugin, 
developed according to the open source software philosophy, where
the CMS Wordpress is used as programmers/coders are
given the potential to develop applications from scratch
with safety and ease. In ODES application there exists two types of users: admin/teacher 
and student. The admin/teacher can create/edit/delete/view questions, 
categories of questions and examination papers. The questions
are divided in two types, multiple choice questions (including true/false) 
and long answer questions (essays). The teacher can create exams choosing the number 
of questions and the types of questions that exist in the pool of questions
that are previously created. The selection is done randomly
by the application and the teacher just determines the
total number of both multiple choice or long answer
questions as well as the importance (weight) of each one
of them (including negative grades also). The student
takes the random generated exam and receives his/hers
grades. The grades of the multiple choice questions are
done automatically, whereas for the long answer questions
the teacher is responsible to put grades on. After the
completion of the exam the teacher can view the studentâ€™s
final score via the control panel or a report.
